# Contributor guidelines

## Making changes

**All new changes must be made on the latest release branch**. If the latest release branch is `release/v1.0`, 
you should make a checkout using `git checkout release/v1.0` and make the changes on that branch.  
  
After you're done, push the changes to your fork and create a pull request to the origin release branch.

## Code style

In order to keep the code style uniform throughout the project, we've provided you with a style file called `codestyle.xml` located in the project's root directory. 
`codestyle.xml` works with [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-code-style.html) and Visual Studio Code.
